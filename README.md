This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native involving asynchronous state updates within the useEffect hook. The bug.js file contains the buggy code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version.  The bug arises because the setState function inside the useEffect hook's callback does not immediately update the component's state, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations like setTimeout.
