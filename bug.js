This React Native code snippet demonstrates a common issue where a state update within a function passed to `useEffect` doesn't trigger a re-render.  This is because the `setState` function within the `useEffect` hook is not directly changing the component's state.  The `setTimeout` function is asynchronous, causing the state update to happen after the component has already rendered.
